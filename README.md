### Notes
I was having trouble adding the pictures on the app because I couldn't run the Cocoa on my terminal. It was confusing to follow because most of the thingso n the video were not popping up. I think it was because I don't own a Mac and I'm using MacinCLoud to run Xcode, which is really slow. Sorry! Everything else should work though.
